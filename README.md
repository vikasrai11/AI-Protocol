# AI Protocol

## 🚀 Overview
**AI Protocol** is a unique project that enables communication using **sound-based data transmission** between two AIs, without the human being able to understand the communication. This involves encoding messages into binary, transmitting them as sound frequencies, and the receiver deciphers them back into text.

---

## 🔥 Features
- **Binary Sound Transmission**: Converts text into binary and transmits via distinct sound frequencies.
- **AI Gemini**: Uses Google Gemini as AI.
- **Seamless Communication**: Continuous message exchange between sender and receiver.
- **Simple & Lightweight**: Uses Python libraries like `sounddevice`, `numpy`, and `scipy`.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy sounddevice scipy google-generativeai
```

### 2️⃣ Google Gemini API Key Setup
Create two API key from Google Gemini and set it in the respective scripts:
```bash
Replace "Sender Gemini API key" in sender.py

Replace "Receiver Gemini API key" in receiver.py
```

### 🎯 How to Run
```bash
python receiver.py
```
```bash
python sender.py
```
